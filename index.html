<p>Surrounded is designed to help you better manage your business logic by keeping cohesive behaviors together. Bring objects together to implement your use cases and gain behavior only when necessary.</p>

<h2>
<a id="how-to-think-about-your-objects" class="anchor" href="#how-to-think-about-your-objects" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How to think about your objects</h2>

<p>First, name the problem you're solving. Then, break down your problem into responsible roles.</p>

<p>Use your problem name as a class and extend it with <code>Surrounded::Context</code></p>

<p>It might look like this:</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-ruby"><pre><span class="pl-k">class</span> <span class="pl-en">Employment</span>
  <span class="pl-k">extend</span> <span class="pl-c1">Surrounded</span>::<span class="pl-c1">Context</span>

  role <span class="pl-c1">:boss</span>
  role <span class="pl-c1">:employee</span>
<span class="pl-k">end</span></pre></div>

<p>In your application, you'll initialize this class with objects to play the roles that you've defined, so you'll need to specify which role players will use which role.</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-ruby"><pre><span class="pl-k">class</span> <span class="pl-en">Employment</span>
  <span class="pl-k">extend</span> <span class="pl-c1">Surrounded</span>::<span class="pl-c1">Context</span>

  <span class="pl-k">initialize</span> <span class="pl-c1">:employee</span>, <span class="pl-c1">:boss</span>

  role <span class="pl-c1">:boss</span>
  role <span class="pl-c1">:employee</span>
<span class="pl-k">end</span></pre></div>

<p>Here, you've specified the order when initializing so you can use it like this:</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-ruby"><pre>user1 <span class="pl-k">=</span> <span class="pl-c1">User</span>.find(<span class="pl-c1">1</span>)
user2 <span class="pl-k">=</span> <span class="pl-c1">User</span>.find(<span class="pl-c1">2</span>)
context <span class="pl-k">=</span> <span class="pl-c1">Employment</span>.<span class="pl-k">new</span>(user1, user2)</pre></div>

<p>That ensures that <code>user1</code> will become (and have all the features of) the <code>employee</code> and <code>user2</code> will become (and have all the features of) the <code>boss</code>.</p>

<p>There are 2 things left to do:</p>

<ol>
<li>define behaviors for each role and</li>
<li>define how you can trigger their actions</li>
</ol>

<p>Currently initializing contexts does not require the use of keyword arguments, <em>but it will in the future</em>.</p>

<p>You should consider using explicit names when initialize now by using <code>keyword_initialize</code>:</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-ruby"><pre><span class="pl-k">class</span> <span class="pl-en">Employment</span>
  <span class="pl-k">extend</span> <span class="pl-c1">Surrounded</span>::<span class="pl-c1">Context</span>

  keyword_initialize <span class="pl-c1">:employee</span>, <span class="pl-c1">:boss</span>
<span class="pl-k">end</span>

user1 <span class="pl-k">=</span> <span class="pl-c1">User</span>.find(<span class="pl-c1">1</span>)
user2 <span class="pl-k">=</span> <span class="pl-c1">User</span>.find(<span class="pl-c1">2</span>)
context <span class="pl-k">=</span> <span class="pl-c1">Employment</span>.<span class="pl-k">new</span>(<span class="pl-c1">employee:</span> user1, <span class="pl-c1">boss:</span> user2)</pre></div>

<p>This will allow you to prepare your accessing code to use keywords.</p>

<h2>
<a id="defining-behaviors-for-roles" class="anchor" href="#defining-behaviors-for-roles" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Defining behaviors for roles</h2>

<p>Behaviors for your roles are easily defined just like you define a method. Provide your role a block and define methods there.</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-ruby"><pre><span class="pl-k">class</span> <span class="pl-en">Employment</span>
  <span class="pl-k">extend</span> <span class="pl-c1">Surrounded</span>::<span class="pl-c1">Context</span>

  <span class="pl-k">initialize</span> <span class="pl-c1">:employee</span>, <span class="pl-c1">:boss</span>

  role <span class="pl-c1">:boss</span>

  role <span class="pl-c1">:employee</span> <span class="pl-k">do</span>
    <span class="pl-k">def</span> <span class="pl-en">work_weekend</span>
      <span class="pl-k">if</span> fed_up?
        quit
      <span class="pl-k">else</span>
        schedule_weekend_work
      <span class="pl-k">end</span>
    <span class="pl-k">end</span>

    <span class="pl-k">def</span> <span class="pl-en">quit</span>
      say(<span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">"</span>I'm sick of this place, <span class="pl-pse">#{</span><span class="pl-s1">boss.name</span><span class="pl-pse"><span class="pl-s1">}</span></span>!<span class="pl-pds">"</span></span>)
      stomp
      throw_papers
      say(<span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">"</span>I quit!<span class="pl-pds">"</span></span>)
    <span class="pl-k">end</span>

    <span class="pl-k">def</span> <span class="pl-en">schedule_weekend_work</span>
      <span class="pl-c"># ...</span>
    <span class="pl-k">end</span>
  <span class="pl-k">end</span>
<span class="pl-k">end</span></pre></div>

<p>If any of your roles don't have special behaviors, like <code>boss</code>, you don't need to specify it. Your <code>initialize</code> setup will handle assiging who's who when this context is used.</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-ruby"><pre><span class="pl-k">class</span> <span class="pl-en">Employment</span>
  <span class="pl-k">extend</span> <span class="pl-c1">Surrounded</span>::<span class="pl-c1">Context</span>

  <span class="pl-k">initialize</span> <span class="pl-c1">:employee</span>, <span class="pl-c1">:boss</span>

  role <span class="pl-c1">:employee</span> <span class="pl-k">do</span>
    <span class="pl-c">#...</span>
  <span class="pl-k">end</span>
<span class="pl-k">end</span></pre></div>

<h2>
<a id="triggering-interactions" class="anchor" href="#triggering-interactions" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Triggering interactions</h2>

<p>You'll need to define way to trigger these behaviors to occur so that you can use them.</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-ruby"><pre>context <span class="pl-k">=</span> <span class="pl-c1">Employment</span>.<span class="pl-k">new</span>(user1, user2)

context.plan_weekend_work</pre></div>

<p>The method you need is defined as an instance method in your context, but before that method will work as expected you'll need to mark it as a trigger.</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-ruby"><pre><span class="pl-k">class</span> <span class="pl-en">Employment</span>
  <span class="pl-k">extend</span> <span class="pl-c1">Surrounded</span>::<span class="pl-c1">Context</span>

  <span class="pl-k">initialize</span> <span class="pl-c1">:employee</span>, <span class="pl-c1">:boss</span>

  <span class="pl-k">def</span> <span class="pl-en">plan_weekend_work</span>
    employee.work_weekend
  <span class="pl-k">end</span>
  trigger <span class="pl-c1">:plan_weekend_work</span>

  role <span class="pl-c1">:employee</span> <span class="pl-k">do</span>
    <span class="pl-c">#...</span>
  <span class="pl-k">end</span>
<span class="pl-k">end</span></pre></div>

<p>Trigger methods are different from regular instance methods in that they apply behaviors from the roles to the role players.
A regular instance method just does what you define. But a trigger will make your role players come alive with their behaviors.</p>

<p>You may find that the code for your triggers is extremely simple and is merely creating a method to tell a role player what to do. If you find you have many methods like this:</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-ruby"><pre>  <span class="pl-k">def</span> <span class="pl-en">plan_weekend_work</span>
    employee.work_weekend
  <span class="pl-k">end</span>
  trigger <span class="pl-c1">:plan_weekend_work</span></pre></div>

<p>You can shorten it to:</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-ruby"><pre>  trigger <span class="pl-c1">:plan_weekend_work</span> <span class="pl-k">do</span>
    employee.work_weekend
  <span class="pl-k">end</span></pre></div>

<p>But it can be even simpler and follows the same pattern provided by Ruby's standard library Forwardable:</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-ruby"><pre>  <span class="pl-c"># The first argument is the role to receive the messaged defined in the second argument.</span>
  <span class="pl-c"># The third argument is optional and if provided will be the name of the trigger method on your context instance.</span>
  forward_trigger <span class="pl-c1">:employee</span>, <span class="pl-c1">:work_weekend</span>, <span class="pl-c1">:plan_weekend_work</span>

  <span class="pl-c"># Alternatively, you can use an API similar to that of the `delegate` method from Forwardable</span>
  forwarding [<span class="pl-c1">:work_weekend</span>] =&gt; <span class="pl-c1">:employee</span></pre></div>

<p>The difference between <code>forward_trigger</code> and <code>forwarding</code> is that the first accepts an alternative method name for the context instance method. There's more on this below in the "Overview in code" section, or see <code>lib/surrounded/context/forwarding.rb</code>.</p>

<p>There's one last thing to make this work.</p>

<h2>
<a id="getting-your-role-players-ready" class="anchor" href="#getting-your-role-players-ready" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Getting your role players ready</h2>

<p>You'll need to include <code>Surrounded</code> in the classes of objects which will be role players in your context.</p>

<p>It's as easy as:</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-ruby"><pre><span class="pl-k">class</span> <span class="pl-en">User</span>
  <span class="pl-k">include</span> <span class="pl-c1">Surrounded</span>

  <span class="pl-c"># ...</span>
<span class="pl-k">end</span></pre></div>

<p>This gives each of the objects the ability to understand its context and direct access to other objects in the context.</p>

<h2>
<a id="why-is-this-valuable" class="anchor" href="#why-is-this-valuable" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why is this valuable?</h2>

<p>By creating environments which encapsulate roles and all necessary behaviors, you will be better able to isolate the logic of your system. A <code>user</code> in your system doesn't have all possible behaviors defined in its class, it gains the behaviors only when they are necessary.</p>

<p>The objects that interact have their behaviors defined and available right where they are needed. Implementation is in proximity to necessity. The behaviors you need for each role player are highly cohesive and are coupled to their use rather than being coupled to the class of an object which might use them at some point.</p>

<p>Typical initialization of an environment, or a Context in DCI, has a lot of code. For example:</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-ruby"><pre><span class="pl-k">class</span> <span class="pl-en">Employment</span>

  <span class="pl-k">attr_reader</span> <span class="pl-c1">:employee</span>, <span class="pl-c1">:boss</span>
  <span class="pl-k">private</span> <span class="pl-c1">:employee</span>, <span class="pl-c1">:boss</span>
  <span class="pl-k">def</span> <span class="pl-en">initialize</span>(<span class="pl-smi">employee</span>, <span class="pl-smi">boss</span>)
    <span class="pl-smi">@employee</span> <span class="pl-k">=</span> employee.<span class="pl-k">extend</span>(<span class="pl-c1">Employee</span>)
    <span class="pl-smi">@boss</span> <span class="pl-k">=</span> boss
  <span class="pl-k">end</span>

  <span class="pl-k">module</span> <span class="pl-en">Employee</span>
    <span class="pl-c"># extra behavior here...</span>
  <span class="pl-k">end</span>
<span class="pl-k">end</span></pre></div>

<p>This code allows the Employment class to create instances where it will have an <code>employee</code> and a <code>boss</code> role internally. These are set to <code>attr_reader</code>s and are made private.</p>

<p>The <code>employee</code> is extended with behaviors defined in the <code>Employee</code> module, and in this case there's no extra stuff for the <code>boss</code> so it doesn't get extended with anything.</p>

<p>Most of the time you'll follow a pattern like this. Some objects will get extra behavior and some won't. The modules that you use to provide the behavior will match the names you use for the roles to which you assign objects.</p>

<p>By adding <code>Surrounded::Context</code> you can shortcut all this work.</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-ruby"><pre><span class="pl-k">class</span> <span class="pl-en">Employment</span>
  <span class="pl-k">extend</span> <span class="pl-c1">Surrounded</span>::<span class="pl-c1">Context</span>

  <span class="pl-k">initialize</span>(<span class="pl-c1">:employee</span>, <span class="pl-c1">:boss</span>)

  <span class="pl-k">module</span> <span class="pl-en">Employee</span>
    <span class="pl-c"># extra behavior here...</span>
  <span class="pl-k">end</span>
<span class="pl-k">end</span></pre></div>

<p>Surrounded gives you an <code>initialize</code> class method which does all the setup work for you.</p>

<h2>
<a id="managing-roles" class="anchor" href="#managing-roles" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Managing Roles</h2>

<p><em>I don't want to use modules. Can't I use something like SimpleDelegator?</em></p>

<p>Well, it just so happens that you can. This code will work just fine:</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-ruby"><pre><span class="pl-k">class</span> <span class="pl-en">Employment</span>
  <span class="pl-k">extend</span> <span class="pl-c1">Surrounded</span>::<span class="pl-c1">Context</span>

  <span class="pl-k">initialize</span>(<span class="pl-c1">:employee</span>, <span class="pl-c1">:boss</span>)

  <span class="pl-k">class</span> <span class="pl-en">Employee<span class="pl-e"> &lt; SimpleDelegator</span></span>
    <span class="pl-c"># extra behavior here...</span>
  <span class="pl-k">end</span>
<span class="pl-k">end</span></pre></div>

<p>Instead of extending the <code>employee</code> object, Surrounded will run <code>Employee.new(employee)</code> to create the wrapper for you. You'll need to include the <code>Surrounded</code> module in your wrapper, but we'll get to that.</p>

<p>But the syntax can be even simpler than that if you want.</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-ruby"><pre><span class="pl-k">class</span> <span class="pl-en">Employment</span>
  <span class="pl-k">extend</span> <span class="pl-c1">Surrounded</span>::<span class="pl-c1">Context</span>

  <span class="pl-k">initialize</span>(<span class="pl-c1">:employee</span>, <span class="pl-c1">:boss</span>)

  role <span class="pl-c1">:employee</span> <span class="pl-k">do</span>
    <span class="pl-c"># extra behavior here...</span>
  <span class="pl-k">end</span>
<span class="pl-k">end</span></pre></div>

<p>By default, this code will create a module for you named <code>Employee</code>. If you want to use a wrapper, you can do this:</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-ruby"><pre><span class="pl-k">class</span> <span class="pl-en">Employment</span>
  <span class="pl-k">extend</span> <span class="pl-c1">Surrounded</span>::<span class="pl-c1">Context</span>

  <span class="pl-k">initialize</span>(<span class="pl-c1">:employee</span>, <span class="pl-c1">:boss</span>)

  wrap <span class="pl-c1">:employee</span> <span class="pl-k">do</span>
    <span class="pl-c"># extra behavior here...</span>
  <span class="pl-k">end</span>
<span class="pl-k">end</span></pre></div>

<p>But if you're making changes and you decide to move from a module to a wrapper or from a wrapper to a module, you'll need to change that method call. Instead, you could just tell it which type of role to use:</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-ruby"><pre><span class="pl-k">class</span> <span class="pl-en">Employment</span>
  <span class="pl-k">extend</span> <span class="pl-c1">Surrounded</span>::<span class="pl-c1">Context</span>

  <span class="pl-k">initialize</span>(<span class="pl-c1">:employee</span>, <span class="pl-c1">:boss</span>)

  role <span class="pl-c1">:employee</span>, <span class="pl-c1">:wrapper</span> <span class="pl-k">do</span>
    <span class="pl-c"># extra behavior here...</span>
  <span class="pl-k">end</span>
<span class="pl-k">end</span></pre></div>

<p>The default available types are <code>:module</code>, <code>:wrap</code> or <code>:wrapper</code>, and <code>:interface</code>. We'll get to <code>interface</code> below. The <code>:wrap</code> and <code>:wrapper</code> types are the same and they'll both create classes which inherit from SimpleDelegator <em>and</em> include Surrounded for you.</p>

<p>These are minor little changes which highlight how simple it is to use Surrounded.</p>

<p><em>Well... I want to use <a href="https://github.com/saturnflyer/casting">Casting</a> so I get the benefit of modules without extending objects. Can I do that?</em></p>

<p>Yup. The ability to use Casting is built-in. If the objects you provide to your context respond to <code>cast_as</code> then Surrounded will use that.</p>

<p><em>Ok. So is that it?</em></p>

<p>There's a lot more. Let's look at the individual objects and what they need for this to be valuable...</p>

<h2>
<a id="objects-access-to-their-environments" class="anchor" href="#objects-access-to-their-environments" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Objects' access to their environments</h2>

<p>Add <code>Surrounded</code> to your objects to give them awareness of other objects.</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-ruby"><pre><span class="pl-k">class</span> <span class="pl-en">User</span>
  <span class="pl-k">include</span> <span class="pl-c1">Surrounded</span>
<span class="pl-k">end</span></pre></div>

<p>Now the <code>User</code> instances will be able to implicitly access objects in their environment.</p>

<p>Via <code>method_missing</code> those <code>User</code> instances can access a <code>context</code> object it stores in an internal collection. </p>

<p>Inside of the <code>Employment</code> context we saw above, the <code>employee</code> and <code>boss</code> objects are instances of <code>User</code> for this example.</p>

<p>Because the <code>User</code> class includes <code>Surrounded</code>, the instances of that class will be able to access other objects in the same context implicitly.</p>

<p>Let's make our context look like this:</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-ruby"><pre><span class="pl-k">class</span> <span class="pl-en">Employment</span>
  <span class="pl-c"># other stuff from above is still here...</span>

  <span class="pl-k">def</span> <span class="pl-en">plan_weekend_work</span>
    employee.quit
  <span class="pl-k">end</span>

  role <span class="pl-c1">:employee</span> <span class="pl-k">do</span>
    <span class="pl-k">def</span> <span class="pl-en">quit</span>
      say(<span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">"</span>I'm sick of this place, <span class="pl-pse">#{</span><span class="pl-s1">boss.name</span><span class="pl-pse"><span class="pl-s1">}</span></span>!<span class="pl-pds">"</span></span>)
      stomp
      throw_papers
      say(<span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">"</span>I quit!<span class="pl-pds">"</span></span>)
    <span class="pl-k">end</span>
  <span class="pl-k">end</span>
<span class="pl-k">end</span></pre></div>

<p>What's happening in there is that when the <code>plan_weekend_work</code> method is called on the instance of <code>Employment</code>, the <code>employee</code> has the ability to refer to <code>boss</code> because it is in the same context, e.g. the same environment.</p>

<p>The behavior defined in the <code>Employee</code> module assumes that it may access other objects in it's local environment. The <code>boss</code> object, for example, is never explicitly passed in as an argument.</p>

<p>What <code>Surrounded</code> does for us is to make the relationship between objects and gives them the ability to access each other. Adding new or different roles to the context now only requires that we add them to the context and nothing else. No explicit references must be passed to each individual method. The objects are aware of the other objects around them and can refer to them by their role name.</p>

<p>I didn't mention how the context is set, however.</p>

<h2>
<a id="tying-objects-together" class="anchor" href="#tying-objects-together" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Tying objects together</h2>

<p>Your context will have methods of it's own which will trigger actions on the objects inside, but we need those trigger methods to set the accessible context for each of the contained objects.</p>

<p>Here's an example of what we want:</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-ruby"><pre><span class="pl-k">class</span> <span class="pl-en">Employment</span>
  <span class="pl-c"># other stuff from above is still here...</span>

  <span class="pl-k">def</span> <span class="pl-en">plan_weekend_work</span>
    employee.store_context(<span class="pl-v">self</span>)
    employee.quit
    employee.remove_context
  <span class="pl-k">end</span>

  role <span class="pl-c1">:employee</span> <span class="pl-k">do</span>
    <span class="pl-k">def</span> <span class="pl-en">quit</span>
      say(<span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">"</span>I'm sick of this place, <span class="pl-pse">#{</span><span class="pl-s1">boss.name</span><span class="pl-pse"><span class="pl-s1">}</span></span>!<span class="pl-pds">"</span></span>)
      stomp
      throw_papers
      say(<span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">"</span>I quit!<span class="pl-pds">"</span></span>)
    <span class="pl-k">end</span>
  <span class="pl-k">end</span>
<span class="pl-k">end</span></pre></div>

<p>Now that the <code>employee</code> has a reference to the context, it won't blow up when it hits <code>boss</code> inside that <code>quit</code> method.</p>

<p>We saw how we were able to clear up a lot of that repetitive work with the <code>initialize</code> method, so this is how we do it here:</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-ruby"><pre><span class="pl-k">class</span> <span class="pl-en">Employment</span>
  <span class="pl-c"># other stuff from above is still here...</span>

  trigger <span class="pl-c1">:plan_weekend_work</span> <span class="pl-k">do</span>
    employee.quit
  <span class="pl-k">end</span>

  role <span class="pl-c1">:employee</span> <span class="pl-k">do</span>
    <span class="pl-k">def</span> <span class="pl-en">quit</span>
      say(<span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">"</span>I'm sick of this place, <span class="pl-pse">#{</span><span class="pl-s1">boss.name</span><span class="pl-pse"><span class="pl-s1">}</span></span>!<span class="pl-pds">"</span></span>)
      stomp
      throw_papers
      say(<span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">"</span>I quit!<span class="pl-pds">"</span></span>)
    <span class="pl-k">end</span>
  <span class="pl-k">end</span>
<span class="pl-k">end</span></pre></div>

<p>By using this <code>trigger</code> keyword, our block is the code we care about, but internally the method is created to first set all the objects' current contexts.</p>

<p>The context will also store the triggers so that you can, for example, provide details outside of the environment about what triggers exist.</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-ruby"><pre>context <span class="pl-k">=</span> <span class="pl-c1">Employment</span>.<span class="pl-k">new</span>(current_user, the_boss)
context.triggers <span class="pl-c">#=&gt; [:plan_weekend_work]</span></pre></div>

<p>You might find that useful for dynamically defining user interfaces.</p>

<p>Sometimes I'd rather not use this DSL, however. I want to just write regular methods. </p>

<p>We can do that too. You'll need to opt in to this by specifying <code>trigger :your_method_name</code> for the methods you want to use.</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-ruby"><pre><span class="pl-k">class</span> <span class="pl-en">Employment</span>
  <span class="pl-c"># other stuff from above is still here...</span>

  <span class="pl-k">def</span> <span class="pl-en">plan_weekend_work</span>
    employee.quit
  <span class="pl-k">end</span>
  trigger <span class="pl-c1">:plan_weekend_work</span>

  <span class="pl-c"># or in Ruby 2.x</span>
  trigger <span class="pl-k">def</span> <span class="pl-en">plan_weekend_work</span>
    employee.quit
  <span class="pl-k">end</span>

  role <span class="pl-c1">:employee</span> <span class="pl-k">do</span>
    <span class="pl-k">def</span> <span class="pl-en">quit</span>
      say(<span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">"</span>I'm sick of this place, <span class="pl-pse">#{</span><span class="pl-s1">boss.name</span><span class="pl-pse"><span class="pl-s1">}</span></span>!<span class="pl-pds">"</span></span>)
      stomp
      throw_papers
      say(<span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">"</span>I quit!<span class="pl-pds">"</span></span>)
    <span class="pl-k">end</span>
  <span class="pl-k">end</span>
<span class="pl-k">end</span></pre></div>

<p>This will allow you to write methods like you normally would. They are aliased internally with a prefix and the method name that you use is rewritten to add and remove the context for the objects in this context. The public API of your class remains the same, but the extra feature of wrapping your method is handled for you.</p>

<p>This works like Ruby's <code>public</code>,<code>protected</code>, and <code>private</code> keywords in that you can send symbols of method names to it. But <code>trigger</code> does not alter the parsing of the document like those core keywords do. In other words, you can't merely type <code>trigger</code> on one line, and have methods added afterward be treated as trigger methods.</p>

<h2>
<a id="access-control-for-triggers" class="anchor" href="#access-control-for-triggers" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Access Control for Triggers</h2>

<p>If you decide to build a user interface from the available triggers, you'll find you need to know what triggers are available.</p>

<p>Fortunately, you can make it easy.</p>

<p>By running <code>protect_triggers</code> you'll be able to define when triggers may or may not be run. You can still run them, but they'll raise an error. Here's an example.</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-ruby"><pre><span class="pl-k">class</span> <span class="pl-en">Employment</span>
  <span class="pl-k">extend</span> <span class="pl-c1">Surrounded</span>::<span class="pl-c1">Context</span>
  protect_triggers

  <span class="pl-k">def</span> <span class="pl-en">plan_weekend_work</span>
    employee.quit
  <span class="pl-k">end</span>
  trigger <span class="pl-c1">:plan_weekend_work</span>

  disallow <span class="pl-c1">:plan_weekend_work</span> <span class="pl-k">do</span>
    employee.bank_balance <span class="pl-k">&gt;</span> <span class="pl-c1">1000000</span>
  <span class="pl-k">end</span>
<span class="pl-k">end</span></pre></div>

<p>Then, when the employee role's <code>bank_balance</code> is greater than <code>1000000</code>, the available triggers won't include <code>:plan_weekend_work</code>.</p>

<p>You can compare the instance of the context by listing <code>all_triggers</code> and <code>triggers</code> to see what could be possible and what's currently possible.</p>

<p>Alternatively, if you just want to define your own methods without the DSL using <code>disallow</code>, you can just follow the pattern of <code>disallow_#{method_name}?</code> when creating your own protection.</p>

<p>In fact, that's exactly what happens with the <code>disallow</code> keyword. After using it here, we'd have a <code>disallow_plan_weekend_work?</code> method defined.</p>

<p>If you call the disallowed trigger directly, you'll raise an <code>Employment::AccessError</code> exception and the code in your trigger will not be run. You may rescue from that or you may rescue from <code>Surrounded::Context::AccessError</code> although you should prefer to use the error name from your own class.</p>

<h2>
<a id="restricting-return-values" class="anchor" href="#restricting-return-values" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Restricting return values</h2>

<p><em>Tell, Don't Ask</em> style programming can better be enforced by following East-oriented Code principles. This means that the return values from methods on your objects should not provide information about their internal state. Instead of returning values, you can enforce that triggers return the context object. This forces you to place context responsiblities inside the context and prevents leaking the details and responsiblities outside of the system.</p>

<p>Here's how you enforce it:</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-ruby"><pre><span class="pl-k">class</span> <span class="pl-en">Employment</span>
  <span class="pl-k">extend</span> <span class="pl-c1">Surrounded</span>::<span class="pl-c1">Context</span>
  east_oriented_triggers
<span class="pl-k">end</span></pre></div>

<p>That's it.</p>

<p>With that change, any trigger you define will execute the block you provide and return <code>self</code>, being the instance of the context.</p>

<h2>
<a id="where-roles-exist" class="anchor" href="#where-roles-exist" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Where roles exist</h2>

<p>By using <code>Surrounded::Context</code> you are declaring a relationship between the objects inside playing your defined roles.</p>

<p>Because all the behavior is defined internally and only relevant internally, those relationships don't exist outside of the environment.</p>

<p>Surrounded makes all of your role modules and classes private constants. It's not a good idea to try to reuse behavior defined for one context in another area.</p>

<h2>
<a id="the-role-dsl" class="anchor" href="#the-role-dsl" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The role DSL</h2>

<p>Using the <code>role</code> method to define modules and classes takes care of the setup for you. This way you can swap between implementations:</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-ruby"><pre>
  <span class="pl-c"># this uses modules which include Surrounded</span>
  role <span class="pl-c1">:source</span> <span class="pl-k">do</span>
    <span class="pl-k">def</span> <span class="pl-en">transfer</span>
      <span class="pl-v">self</span>.balance <span class="pl-k">-=</span> amount
      destination.balance <span class="pl-k">+=</span> amount
      <span class="pl-v">self</span>
    <span class="pl-k">end</span>
  <span class="pl-k">end</span>

  <span class="pl-c"># this uses SimpleDelegator and Surrounded</span>
  role <span class="pl-c1">:source</span>, <span class="pl-c1">:wrap</span> <span class="pl-k">do</span>
    <span class="pl-k">def</span> <span class="pl-en">transfer</span>
      <span class="pl-v">self</span>.balance <span class="pl-k">-=</span> amount
      destination.balance <span class="pl-k">+=</span> amount
      __getobj__
    <span class="pl-k">end</span>
  <span class="pl-k">end</span>

  <span class="pl-c"># this uses a special interface object which pulls</span>
  <span class="pl-c"># methods from a module and applies them to your object.</span>
  role <span class="pl-c1">:source</span>, <span class="pl-c1">:interface</span> <span class="pl-k">do</span>
    <span class="pl-k">def</span> <span class="pl-en">transfer</span>
      <span class="pl-v">self</span>.balance <span class="pl-k">-=</span> amount
      <span class="pl-c"># not able to access destination unless the object playing source is Surrounded</span>
      destination.balance <span class="pl-k">+=</span> amount
      <span class="pl-v">self</span>
    <span class="pl-k">end</span>
  <span class="pl-k">end</span></pre></div>

<p>The <code>:interface</code> option is a special object which has all of the standard Object methods removed (excepting ones like <code>__send__</code> and <code>object_id</code>) so that other methods will be pulled from the ones that you define, or from the object it attempts to proxy.</p>

<p>Notice that the <code>:interface</code> allows you to return <code>self</code> whereas the <code>:wrap</code> acts more like a wrapper and forces you to deal with that shortcoming by using it's wrapped-object-accessor method: <code>__getobj__</code>.</p>

<p>The downside of using an interface is that it is still a wrapper and it only has access to the other objects in the context if the wrapped object already includes Surrounded. All of your defined role methods are executed in the context of the object playing the role, but the interface has it's own identity.</p>

<p>If you'd like to choose one and use it all the time, you can set the default:</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-ruby"><pre><span class="pl-k">class</span> <span class="pl-en">MoneyTransfer</span>
  <span class="pl-k">extend</span> <span class="pl-c1">Surrounded</span>::<span class="pl-c1">Context</span>

  <span class="pl-v">self</span>.default_role_type <span class="pl-k">=</span> <span class="pl-c1">:interface</span> <span class="pl-c"># also :wrap, :wrapper, or :module</span>

  role <span class="pl-c1">:source</span> <span class="pl-k">do</span>

      destination.balance <span class="pl-k">+=</span> amount
      <span class="pl-v">self</span>
    <span class="pl-k">end</span>
  <span class="pl-k">end</span>
<span class="pl-k">end</span></pre></div>

<p>Or, if you like, you can choose the default for your entire project:</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-ruby"><pre><span class="pl-c1">Surrounded</span>::<span class="pl-c1">Context</span>.default_role_type <span class="pl-k">=</span> <span class="pl-c1">:interface</span>

<p>If you want to use an Array of objects (for example) as a role player in your context,
you may do so. If you want each item in your collection to gain behavior, you merely need to
create a role for the items.</p>

<p>Surrounded will attempt to guess at the singular role name. For example, a role player named <code>members</code> would
be given the behaviors from a <code>Members</code> behavior module or class. Each item in your <code>members</code> collection
would be given behavior from a <code>Member</code> behavior module or class if you create one.</p>

<p>The dependencies are minimal. The plan is to keep it that way but allow you to configure things as you need. The <a href="http://github.com/saturnflyer/triad">Triad</a> project was written specifically to manage the mapping of roles and objects to the modules which contain the behaviors. It is used in Surrounded to keep track of role player, roles, and role constant names but it is not a hard requirement. You may implement your own but presently you'll need to dive into the implementation to fully understand how. Future updates may provide better support and guidance.</p>

<p>If you're using <a href="http://github.com/saturnflyer/casting">Casting</a>, for example, Surrounded will attempt to use that before extending an object, but it will still work without it.</p>

<p>Surrounded is designed to be flexible for you. If you have your own code to manage applying behaviors, you can setup your context class to use it.</p>

<p>Here's an example using <a href="https://github.com/saturnflyer/behavioral">Behavioral</a></p>

<div class="highlight highlight-ruby"><pre><span class="pl-k">class</span> <span class="pl-en">MyCustomContext</span>
  <span class="pl-k">extend</span> <span class="pl-c1">Surrounded</span>::<span class="pl-c1">Context</span>

  <span class="pl-k">initialize</span> <span class="pl-c1">:employee</span>, <span class="pl-c1">:boss</span>

  <span class="pl-k">def</span> <span class="pl-en">module_extension_methods</span>
    [<span class="pl-c1">:with_behaviors</span>].concat(<span class="pl-k">super</span>)
  <span class="pl-k">end</span>

  <span class="pl-k">def</span> <span class="pl-en">module_removal_methods</span>
    [<span class="pl-c1">:without_behaviors</span>].concat(<span class="pl-k">super</span>)
  <span class="pl-k">end</span>
<span class="pl-k">end</span></pre></div>

<p>If you're using your own non-SimpleDelegator wrapper you can conform to that; whatever it may be.</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-ruby"><pre><span class="pl-k">class</span> <span class="pl-en">MyCustomContext</span>
  <span class="pl-k">extend</span> <span class="pl-c1">Surrounded</span>::<span class="pl-c1">Context</span>

  <span class="pl-k">initialize</span> <span class="pl-c1">:employee</span>, <span class="pl-c1">:boss</span>

  <span class="pl-k">class</span> <span class="pl-en">Employee<span class="pl-e"> &lt; SuperWrapper</span></span>
    <span class="pl-k">include</span> <span class="pl-c1">Surrounded</span>

    [<span class="pl-c1">:wrapped_object</span>]
  <span class="pl-k">end</span>
<span class="pl-k">end</span></pre></div>

<h3>
<a id="applying-individual-roles" class="anchor" href="#applying-individual-roles" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Applying individual roles</h3>

<p>If you'd like to use a special approach for just a single role, you may do that too.</p>

<p>When applying behaviors from a role to your role players, your Surrounded context will first look for a method named  <code>"apply_behavior_#{role}"</code>. Define your own method and set it to accept 2 arguments: the role constant and the role player.</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-ruby"><pre><span class="pl-k">class</span> <span class="pl-en">MyCustomContext</span>
  <span class="pl-k">extend</span> <span class="pl-c1">Surrounded</span>::<span class="pl-c1">Context</span>

  <span class="pl-k">initialize</span> <span class="pl-c1">:employee</span>, <span class="pl-c1">:boss</span>

  <span class="pl-k">def</span> <span class="pl-en">apply_behavior_employee</span>(<span class="pl-smi">behavior_constant</span>, <span class="pl-smi">role_player</span>)
    behavior_constant.build(role_player).apply <span class="pl-c"># or whatever your need to do with your constant and object.</span>
  <span class="pl-k">end</span>
<span class="pl-k">end</span></pre></div>

<p>You can also plan for special ways to remove behavior as well.</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-ruby"><pre><span class="pl-k">class</span> <span class="pl-en">MyCustomContext</span>
  <span class="pl-k">extend</span> <span class="pl-c1">Surrounded</span>::<span class="pl-c1">Context</span>

  <span class="pl-k">initialize</span> <span class="pl-c1">:employee</span>, <span class="pl-c1">:boss</span>

  <span class="pl-k">def</span> <span class="pl-en">remove_behavior_employee</span>(<span class="pl-smi">behavior_constant</span>, <span class="pl-smi">role_player</span>)
    role_player.cleanup <span class="pl-c"># or whatever your need to do with your constant and object.</span>
  <span class="pl-k">end</span>
<span class="pl-k">end</span></pre></div>

<p>You can remember the method name by the convention that <code>remove</code> or <code>apply</code> describes it's function, <code>behavior</code> refers to the first argument (thet contsant holding the behaviors), and then the name of the role which refers to the role playing object: <code>remove_behavior_role</code>.</p>

<h2>
<a id="how-to-read-this-code" class="anchor" href="#how-to-read-this-code" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How to read this code</h2>

<p>If you use this library, it's important to understand it.</p>

<p>As much as possible, when you use the Surrounded DSL for creating triggers, roles, initialize methods, and others you'll likely fine the actual method definitions created in a module and then find that module included in your class.</p>

<p>This is a design choice which allows you to override any standard behavior more easily.</p>

<h3>
<a id="where-methods-exist-and-why" class="anchor" href="#where-methods-exist-and-why" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Where methods exist and why</h3>

<p>When you define an initialize method for a Context class, Surrounded <em>could</em> define the method on your class like this:</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-ruby"><pre><span class="pl-k">def</span> <span class="pl-en">initialize</span>(<span class="pl-k">*</span><span class="pl-smi">roles</span>)
  <span class="pl-v">self</span>.class_eval <span class="pl-k">do </span><span class="pl-c"># &lt;=== this evaluates on _your_ class and defines it there.</span>
    <span class="pl-c"># code...</span>
  <span class="pl-k">end</span>
<span class="pl-k">end</span></pre></div>

<p>If we used the above approach, you'd need to redefine initialize in its entirety:</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-ruby"><pre><span class="pl-k">initialize</span>(<span class="pl-c1">:role1</span>, role2)

<span class="pl-k">def</span> <span class="pl-en">initialize</span>(<span class="pl-smi">role1</span>, <span class="pl-smi">role2</span>) <span class="pl-c"># &lt;=== this will completely redefine initialize on _this class_</span>
  <span class="pl-k">super</span> <span class="pl-c"># &lt;=== this will NOT be the initialize method as provided to the Surrounded initialize above.</span>
<span class="pl-k">end</span></pre></div>

<p>Surrounded uses a more flexible approach for you:</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-ruby"><pre><span class="pl-k">def</span> <span class="pl-en">initialize</span>(<span class="pl-k">*</span><span class="pl-smi">roles</span>)
  mod <span class="pl-k">=</span> <span class="pl-c1">Module</span>.<span class="pl-k">new</span>
  mod.class_eval <span class="pl-k">do </span><span class="pl-c"># &lt;=== this evaluates on the module and defines it there.</span>
    <span class="pl-c"># code...</span>
  <span class="pl-k">end</span>
  <span class="pl-k">include</span> mod <span class="pl-c"># &lt;=== this adds it to the class ancestors</span>
<span class="pl-k">end</span></pre></div>

<p>With this approach you can use the way Surrounded is setup, but make changes if you need.</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-ruby"><pre><span class="pl-k">initialize</span>(<span class="pl-c1">:role1</span>, <span class="pl-c1">:role2</span>) <span class="pl-c"># &lt;=== defined in a module in the class ancestors</span>

<span class="pl-k">def</span> <span class="pl-en">initialize</span>(<span class="pl-smi">role1</span>, <span class="pl-smi">role2</span>)
  <span class="pl-k">super</span> <span class="pl-c"># &lt;=== run the method as defined above in the Surrounded DSL</span>
  <span class="pl-c"># ... then do additional work</span>
<span class="pl-k">end</span></pre></div>
